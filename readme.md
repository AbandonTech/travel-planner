## Project Overview
I now have multiple spreadsheets used to create travel plans. Travel locations need dates and various locations can be 
convenient to visit in a single trip during my overall travel plans. 
I also have the need to share my travel plans with an easy, public site.

This site mainly aims to help with travel organization. An example being:
I want to visit the Pantheon and Trevi Fountain in rome on a single day-trip. I want to create a convenient route to 
sight-see as well as figure out meals, shopping, etc. A website would make a very convenient way to enter travel info
and group destinations into larger trips. An entire trip can be made up of restaurants, landmarks, shopping, coffee,
etc.
